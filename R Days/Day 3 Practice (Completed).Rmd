# Take-home Practice

From the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/03/the-score-of-every-basketball-football-and-baseball-game-in-league-history-visualized/?variant=116ae929826d1fd3), professional sports scores follow certain distributions. Let's try to recreate the following graphs using `rxxxx` and then answer some questions using our distribution functions.

## Binomial Distribution

I played around and the best match is with $n = 80$ and $p = 0.06$, so use those for this.

```{r}
sample <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 80, prob = 0.06)
hist(sample)
```

Using these parameters, calculate the following

- Calculate the probability that more than 10 points are scored in a game

```{r}
1 - pbinom(q = 10, size = 80, prob = 0.06)
```

- Calculate the probability of the most common score, 3.

```{r}
dbinom(x = 3, size = 80, prob = 0.06)
```


## Normal Distribution

Play around with the mean and sd to try to recreate this figure using `rnorm` and `hist` 

*Hint: the 68-95-98 rule can help*

```{r}
sample <- rnorm(10000, mean = 102, sd = 15)
hist(sample)
```

Using these parameters, calculate the following

- What is the probability of a game having fewer than 80 points?

```{r}
pnorm(80, mean = 102, sd = 15)
```


- What is the probability of a game having more than 130 points

```{r}
1 - pnorm(130, mean = 102, sd = 15)
```

- What is the probability of having a score between 100 and 110

```{r}
pnorm(110, mean = 102, sd = 15) - pnorm(100, mean = 102, sd = 15)
```
