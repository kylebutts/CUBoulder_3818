# Accessing Variables

Let's load the penguin dataset from last time:

```{r}
penguins <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv")
```

## Accessing individual observations/variables


To access an individual variable, we can use the `$` or `[]` operators. For the `[]` operator, you there are two options and are separated by a comma. The first option describes the rows you want, the second option describes the columns you want. Leaving either blank is equivalent to "all".

```{r}
summary(penguins$body_mass_g)

penguins[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), c("island", "species")]
penguins[1:6, ]
penguins[1:6, c("island", "species", "body_mass_g")]

penguins[1:6, ]$island

mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
penguins$body_mass_g
```

You can pair these together, for example let's say I want the variable `island` for the first 6 observations:

```{r}
# Two ways to do it. How are they different?
penguins[1:6, "island"]
penguins[1:6, ]$island
```



### Exercise

Use the `unique()` function to find the unique values of the variable `species` in the penguins dataset.

```{r}
unique(penguins$species)
```



## Selecting rows based on criteria

Lets see which penguins live on Torgersen.

```{r}
# Create vector of True and False
penguins$island == "Torgersen"
```

Can use vector of True and False to select rows that match criteria: 

```{r}

in_torgersen <- penguins$island == "Torgersen"
in_torgersen
penguins[in_torgersen, ]
```

You can also use the following operators to supply multiple criteria:

- `&` And operator. Both vector 1 **and** vector 2 must be true for the observation
- `|` Or operator. **Either** vector 1 **or** vector 2 must be true for the observation

```{r}
penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen" & penguins$species == "Adelie", ]

penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen" | penguins$species == "Adelie", ]
```


### Exercise

Now try and answer the following question. Are all three species present on the Torgersen island?

```{r}
unique(penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen", ]$species)
```



### Exercise

![Penguin Beak Measurements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/culmen_depth.png)

Lets compare Bill Length and Bill Depth between the three species of penguins in our dataset: the Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins.

Using `[]` and `<-`, create 3 dataframes called `penguins_ad`, `penguins_gent`, and `penguins_chin` that subset based on the correct species of penguins. 

```{r}
penguins_ad <- penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie", ]
penguins_gent <- penguins[penguins$species == "Gentoo", ]
penguins_chin <- penguins[penguins$species == "Chinstrap", ]
```


What is the mean of each species bill length in millimeters? (remember there are NAs so we will need to use `na.rm = TRUE`).

```{r}
mean(penguins_ad$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(penguins_gent$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(penguins_chin$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```


# Creating new variables

We can create variables in our dataset by using the `$` or `[]` operators with `<-`.

```{r}
# 0.0022 lbs = 1 g
penguins$body_mass_lb <- 0.00220462 * penguins$body_mass_g
penguins$body_mass_lb

summary(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```




### Exericse

Your R exercise asks you to calculate the standard deviation without using the `var()` or `sd()` command. We want to remove `NA`s manually to fix this. A helpful command is `is.na()`. Let's practice computing the variance of body_mass_lb by hand. You will want to use `nrow()`

```{r}
# Remove NAs
body_mass_no_na <- penguins[!is.na(penguins$body_mass_lb), "body_mass_lb"]

deviations <- body_mass_no_na - mean(body_mass_no_na)
n <- length(body_mass_no_na)

sum(deviations^2) / (n - 1)
```



# Graphing Data

## Histograms

Common functions for graphing are `hist()` for plotting one variable and `plot()` for plotting two variables. 

```{r}
# Count
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```

You can add additional commands for better plots. Use `?hist` or `help("hist")` to see the list of options. 

### Exercise

Type `?hist` into the console and Find the following options:

- Find the option that will give you probabilities

```{r}
# Probability
```

- the bar color
- the number of breaks
- the x-axis label
- add a title


```{r}
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb,
  col = "lightblue", breaks = 20,
  main = "Histogram of Penguin Body Mass",
  xlab = "Weight (in lb)", freq = FALSE
)
```

### Exercise

Using different `col` for each species of penguin,  make a histogram of the three species' bill length.

```{r}

hist(penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie", "bill_length_mm"], col = "red")
hist(penguins[penguins$species == "Gentoo", "bill_length_mm"], col = "blue")
hist(penguins[penguins$species == "Chinstrap", "bill_length_mm"], col = "green")
```

Knit your file and compare the distributions of the bill lengths. Include a comment about the Mean and the Variance. Which Distribution looks symmetric?


## Box plots

Box plots are also easy in R. First lets make a box plot of `flipper_length_mm` among the entire sample.

```{r}
boxplot(penguins$flipper_length_mm, ylab = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

If we want to do more fancy plotting, we can use a `formula` that looks like this:

`variable ~ by`

where `variable` is the variable we want to make a box plot of and `by` is the variable that we want to break out into groups:

```{r}
boxplot(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
```

### Exercise

Let's see if the weights of Adelie penguins appear to have a different distribution of `body_mass_lb` by island:

```{r}
boxplot(body_mass_lb ~ island, data = penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie", ])
```



## Scatter Plots

While we haven't talked about this yet, it is typically of interest to compare multiple variables together. To plot two variables, we will use the `plot()` function to make scatter plots.

```{r}
plot(penguins$flipper_length_mm, penguins$body_mass_lb,
  main = "Scatter Plot of Penguin Data",
  xlab = "Flipper Lenght (in mm)",
  ylab = "Weight (in lb)"
)
```





## ggplot2

There is a package called `ggplot2` that improves base Rs graphing library. We will not cover the details here, but a curious student can find much more details here: https://ggplot2-book.org/

This is a particularly nice introduction: https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/post/06-ggplot2/

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_lb, color = species, fill = species), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Penguin Body Mass, by species",
    x = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  scale_fill_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_lb, color = species)) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Penguin Data, by species",
    x = "Flipper Length (in mm)",
    y = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

`ggplot2` makes it really easy to make beautiful and professional graphs and it would be a **really** useful skill to have in your career

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  aes(
    x = bill_length_mm,
    y = bill_depth_mm,
    group = species
  )
) +
  geom_point(aes(
    color = species,
    shape = species
  ),
  size = 3,
  alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin bill dimensions",
    subtitle = "Bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Bill length (mm)",
    y = "Bill depth (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species",
    shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
    plot.caption.position = "plot"
  )
```
