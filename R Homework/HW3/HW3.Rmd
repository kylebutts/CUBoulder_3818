## Question 3 

```{r Confidence Interval Program}
# This makes sure we get the same random numbers every time
set.seed(123)

# Setting the parameters of the simulation
sample_size <- 100
num_samples <- 50
ci_level <- 0.95

# theoretical pop mean / standard deviation (sd) for standard normal
pop_mean <- 0
pop_sd <- 1


# Uses `for` loop, draws `sample_size` from random normal and makes mean

# What we will store sample means into 
sample_means <- c()

for(i in 1:num_samples){
	# Draw normal random variable
	sample <- rnorm(n= sample_size, mean= pop_mean, sd= pop_sd)
	
	# Mean 
	sample_mean <- mean(sample)
	
	# Store result in position `i` from loop.
	sample_means[i] <- sample_mean
}

# finding the margin of error
moe <- qnorm(1 - (1-ci_level)/2) * pop_sd / sqrt(sample_size)

# binding x\bar-moe and x\bar+moe as two columns
CI <- data.frame(CI_lower= sample_means - moe, CI_upper= sample_means + moe)

# to make the nice picture, you need the user written package ggplot2
# you might need to type: install.packages("ggplot2") into the console if you get an error
require(ggplot2)

# a logical vector, TRUE if the confidence interval captures the population mean
CI$is_mu_in_CI <- ((pop_mean > CI$CI_lower) & (pop_mean < CI$CI_upper))

## making the plot
ggplot() +
  geom_linerange(
    aes(x = 1:num_samples,
        ymin = CI$CI_lower, 
        ymax = CI$CI_upper, 
        col = CI$is_mu_in_CI,
        )
    ) + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("TRUE"="alice","FALSE"="red")) +
  guides(col= FALSE) +
  labs(title= "Confidence Intervals", x= "Sample Number") +
  geom_hline(yintercept= pop_mean, col= "red") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim= c(pop_mean-pop_sd, pop_mean+pop_sd))


# What percent of the confidence intervals capture the population mean?
mean(CI$is_mu_in_CI)
