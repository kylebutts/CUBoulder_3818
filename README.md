# Economics 3818 (Fall 2021): Introduction to Statistics with Computer Applications 

Econ 3818 is an introductory course in the theory and methods of statistics. Statistics allows datasets to be transformed into usable information, analyzed for patterns and trends, which improve decision-making.

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to
1. Be prepared for a future course in Econometrics { the data driven side of economics.
2. Will be able to load datasets into R and perform statistical methods to gather information about the data.
3. Understand the probability theory behind basic statistical tests and implement the methods.

We will study basic probability, probability distributions (especially the normal distribution), and descriptive and inferential statistics, including estimation and hypothesis testing. Emphasis is on both theory and applications. Weekly problem sets will explore issues in statistical theory and practice. The course will use the programming language R to do data analysis on simulated and real datasets

## Textbook 
*The Basic Practice of Statistics*. David Moore, William Notz, and Michael A Fligner.
